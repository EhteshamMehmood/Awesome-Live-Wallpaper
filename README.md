NOTE: This is not finished project I mean publish ready or however you call it. I have zero experience how to publish things on market + I dont even have account obviously, nor I know how to make final build YET, wallpaper is kinda finished tho, but lacks settings, tested on S1, galaxy Tab something and on emulators.
